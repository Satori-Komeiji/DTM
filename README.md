# DTM's THcrap Repository

Hello and welcome to my patch repository for the games in the Touhou series.  These patches use the [thcrap patching engine](https://thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center) which allows automatic updating and the ability to not have to modify game files.  Currently, the repository includes:
* **[alphes:](https://github.com/DTM9025/DTM/tree/master/alphes)**  Alphes Styled Character Portraits (Art by Dairi)

To use any of these patches, simply download [thcrap](https://thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download), run the configurer, and select the desired patch.  Note that generally, these patches should be selected after a language patch if you also want to use said language patch (e.g. lang_en -> alphes).  More detailed instructions are in the respective patch folder's README.

Message from Satori:

This is just my little addition to DTM's project.
The only thing I've done is correct the image sizes on th09 (PoFV) so that they are compatible with a th##.dat compressor like Touhou Toolkit.
That way if you've been having problems with Thcrap (like I've had) or maybe you just want to use the english patch by Rufus, then you're free to make your own th09.dat file and not have to worry about Thcrap.

If there are anymore images that need to be resized the please feel free to message me or leave a comment on my fork.
I haven't had any problems running Thcrap on any of the other Touhou games except th09 (PoFV). so I haven't had a need to check any of the other image sizes.  I'd like to encourage you to use the original DTM's repo if you're using Thcrap.  Only download mine if you need to compile the th09.dat file yourself.

Thanks.
